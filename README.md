# React Challenge - Press Typer
This is a beginner challenge to develop basic react knowledge, logic and problem solving.
The objective of this problem is to have cells that can be occupied by letters, if we click between the cells a new empty cell will appear that can hold a new letter.

### What can be improved
* The keydown handler have some edge cases that haven't been dealt with (its 4:32AM, kinda tired right now c:)
* The design can also be improved (wish I was great at CSS, will master it someday)
* Probably some refactoring
